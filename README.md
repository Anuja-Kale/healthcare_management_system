## Project Scope:

The healthcare organization in the United States aims to track and categorize patient data according to their individual pharmacies. In order to offer their patients the best service, we wish to set up an automated medicine distribution system. Pharmacies, medicine orders, healthcare providers, and patients are the four main components of this management system.

## Project Description:

•	Patients' data will be categorized in the Healthcare data management system according to their healthcare providers and pharmacies. 
   
•	The system is organized as follows: 

1. The healthcare providers will provide services to the patients (Clinics, Hospitals, etc). 
2. Based on the prescriptions issued by heath care providers, orders will be generated.
3. Based on the pharmacies that will be dispensing the pharmaceuticals, order data will be divided into groups.
4. The medications being prescribed to various patients will have a periodic structure.
